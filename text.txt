Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
It is Spring, moonless night in the small town, starless and bible-black, the cobblestreets silent
